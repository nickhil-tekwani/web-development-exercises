      <p class="app-info"> This is a lightweight app used for keeping track of a list of courses (name and description). <br />
      <br />
      Once a new course is submitted, you will view it on the list below the form.  <br />
      You can view its details (unique ID assigned from backend, given name, and currnet description). <br />
      You can change the description (but not the name) using the input field on the appropriate line, then clicking submit new desc.  <br />
      You can also delete the course entirely which will remove it from all back end records and remove it from the list. <br />
      <br />
      Unique ID's are auto assigned upon submission of form by the backend.  <br />
      Created times and updated times (for desc updates) are tracked as well for reference.  <br />
      <br />
      NOTE that the order shown will not necessarily stay the same after a new update to the database (upon changing description or deleting course).  <br />

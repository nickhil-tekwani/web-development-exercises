You will see the same code from quiz 2, Now the menu have 3 more menu options: `Add Red`, `Add Yellow` and `Add Blue`.
The end goal is to achieve the behaivour seen in the gif below.

1. The `Add Red` option should insert the following HTML after the menu: `<div class="section-color red">test</div>`
2. The `Add Blue` option should insert the following HTML after the menu: `<div class="section-color blue">test</div>`
3. The `Add Yellow` option should insert the following HTML after the menu: `<div class="section-color yellow">test</div>`
4. You don't need to worry about the `css`, the needed classess are already created.
5. Make sure that the rest of the menu options don't have any behaivour
6. Each element have a data atribute that you can use `data-color="red"`, `data-color="yellow"` and `data-color="blue"`

-do you need to create 3 event listeners or you can do it all in one?
